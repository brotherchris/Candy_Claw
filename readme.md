Candy Claw
This version is much easier to build than the first version. 

Created for video build series November 2022 by Chris Riley of Chrisâ€™s Basement https://www.youtube.com/ChrisRiley 


The candy claw was designed to be as close to a 3D printer as possible. It runs on 4 NEMA 17 motors, a 2020 aluminum frame, V slot wheel carts, a RAMPS controller board and right out of the box Marlin firmware.

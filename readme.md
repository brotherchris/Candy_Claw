Candy Claw
PLEASE DON’T BUILD THIS VERSION. A MUCH BETTER VERSION WILL BE AVAILABLE SOON!!!! THIS IS JUST FOR REFERENCE. 

Created for ERRF The East Coast REPRAP Festival 2022 by Chris Riley of Chris’s Basement https://www.youtube.com/ChrisRiley 


The candy claw was designed to be as close to a 3D printer as possible. It runs on 4 NEMA 17 motors, a 2020 aluminum frame, V slot wheel carts, a RAMPS controller board and right out of the box Marlin firmware.
